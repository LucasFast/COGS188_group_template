    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  This repo is assuming you want to do (1).  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the Gradescope proposal for that instead of using this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical price data and financial indicators. The dataset used will consist of more than 10,000 observations and over 10 variables, including stock prices, trading volumes, and technical indicators such as moving averages and Relative Strength Index (RSI). The data will be measured, capturing detailed historical trends and market behaviors. The project will involve feature selection to identify the most relevant predictors, followed by the application of time series forecasting models. We will also use Monte Carlo simulations  to model the uncertainty and variability in stock price predictions.  The performance of the predictive models will be evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess their accuracy and reliability. Success will be measured by our models' ability to accurately predict stock prices,  providing valuable insights for potential investors."
