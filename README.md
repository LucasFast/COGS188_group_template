How to run our program:

1. This project needs to be run in Google Colab.
2. One of the datasets used is available in the GitHub.
3. The other dataset is too large so it must be downloaded from the link. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kylegraupe/aapl-options-data-2016-2020)
4. pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn keras statsmodels tensorflow
